          <div class="section-text">
            <p>
              The story of Left 4 Dead 2 first takes place in Savannah, Georgia.
              After the past event in Left 4 Dead 1. The four survivor climbs to
              the rooftop to witness the last rescue helicopter leave them. This
              is where they greet and know each other. Namely: Ellis, Coach,
              Rochelle and Nick. After that they decided to find evacuations to
              go to another rescue place where they can find help. The first
              place is exiting the building and going to the mall where they
              find a sports car and ellis had an idea to fill it up with gas so
              they can make a drive to New Orleans where they heard to be the
              last standing city of America. The team found a bridge in Rayford
              where they met the first team survivors in Left 4 Dead 1. Namely:
              Francis, Louis and Zoey. Their one member Bill sacrificed his life
              to raise the bridge thats why hes no longer here. The current
              survivors needs to cross the bridge they must find another way to
              across and refill the generator. While battling the infected by
              the first team they began to refill the generator and after that
              the 2 team met again and help them lower the bridge.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br />
              The current team began to drive off the bridge to Griffin County,
              where they come ahead to the whispering oaks amusement park. Where
              they go to the peach pit that is abandoned by midnight riders. The
              survivors succeed to get the helicopters attention to help them
              while the infected swarm the stadium. After being rescued the
              pilot becomes infected so nick shoot him causing the helicopter to
              crash. After the crash they went to discover a small village where
              a lot of villagers where infected as they go ahead to the swamp
              they come across a lot of dead militaries and crashed planes. The
              previous survivors informed the passerby to go to the plantation
              house. Where they find a radio that helps them contact virgil for
              rescue. Before fending off the horde, virgil blasts the plantation
              gate open to allow the survivors to escape on his boat before the
              horde could get them. While on their way the boat began to low on
              gas so they stopped at ducatel, Mississippi to find gas. The gas
              station that has supply are around two miles away so they pass
              through an abandoned sugar mill where they found a lot of witches.

              After collecting what they needed they began to go back but a
              heavy storm hits. Coach comes up with the idea to use the burger
              tanks signal to get virgils attention to pick them up before the
              swarm get them they left successfully. Virgil drops the team to
              New Orleans. After virgil dropped them they go outside of the safe
              house where they see jets and militaries in the area revealing
              that the military has not abandoned the city yet. They decided
              that the bridge is the best chance of survival but discovers that
              a lot of non-infected people corpses are on the way. They
              discovered that the military will bomb the bridge so they quickly
              pass across the bridge on all their power. As they pass the bridge
              they reached the 2 military the papa gator and rescue 7 who
              suspect that the survivors are carriers. Rescue 7 is prepared to
              carry the carriers, papa gator informs the survivor that they are
              lucky the military just left the are with them. As they are
              carried in the rescue helicopter the fighter jets bombed the
              bridge where they cross to prevent the infected from leaving the
              city and the pilot takes the survivors out to a military cruise
              ship at sea. This is where the story of Left 4 Dead 2 ends.

              The Survivors are people in the world who have not contracted the
              Infection (either by virtue of being a carrier or possessing some
              form of immunity). The term, however, is commonly used to refer to
              the eight playable characters from the Left 4 Dead game series.
              <br /><br />
              At the start of the first campaign in Left 4 Dead 2, the playable
              characters have just met each other and do not know each other's
              names. There are also non-playable Survivors that players will
              meet throughout the campaigns. In the comic, the Survivors are
              referred to as "Tango-Mike" (T-M in the NATO Alphabet) by the APC
              Driver, probably in reference to Typhoid Mary, the most notorious
              real-life carrier known in America.
              <br /><br />
              Each playable Survivor has their own unique appearance,
              personality, dialogue, and backstory, making them easier to
              identify at a distance. Players can choose which Survivor they
              control in the lobby, or be automatically assigned to a Survivor
              that is not being controlled by a player when they join a game
              that is already in progress. Every Survivor plays the same; their
              physical differences are purely cosmetic and do not alter
              gameplay. When controlled as AI Bots, Survivors will have
              preference over specific weaponry, and will attempt to choose that
              type if possible.

              The Infected (sometimes referred to simply as Zombies by the
              survivors) are Left 4 Dead's take on the classic movie and
              pop-fiction zombie. Rather than being undead, they are living
              humans who have been Infected by the Green Flu virus, causing
              massively increased aggression and loss of many higher brain
              functions such as speech and self-preservation. Like cinematic
              zombies, those present in the Left 4 Dead series attack human
              victims until they themselves perish or kill their target.
              <br /><br />
              In the cases of Common and Uncommon Infected, observed
              aggressiveness manifests itself primarily in the form of frenzied
              physical blows and kicks. Bite attacks are of a secondary nature
              and may even be incidentally delivered. The Infected primarily
              attack uninfected humans who have attracted attention through
              noise, movement, displaying bright lights, or anything covered in
              Boomer Bile (whether it be from a Bile Bomb or the Boomer itself).
              Common Infected are also frequently observed displaying mutual
              aggressiveness towards one another. However, these attacks cease
              when the Infected find and focus on an uninfected human.
              <br /><br />
              The Special Infected have higher intelligence than the Common
              Infected, as they are not attracted by car alarms or loud noise
              and are able to run away if required to set up an ambush. They are
              also more aggressive than the Common Infected, as they will
              actively attack Survivors rather than passively sitting in a
              stupor until disturbed (except for the Witch and the Tank, which
              will wait for the Survivors to alert or attack them).

              <p>
                Swamp Fever is Left 4 Dead 2's fourth campaign. Swamp Fever
                spans four long chapters and takes place in Louisiana-type
                bayous and swamplands near a shanty town called Village En
                Marais.

                Hard Rain is the fifth campaign in Left 4 Dead 2, taking place
                after Swamp Fever. It is set in the riverside town of Ducatel,
                Mississippi as a hurricane approaches.

              <p>
                The Parish is the final campaign in Left 4 Dead 2 and is set in
                New Orleans, Louisiana. The campaign involves traveling from The
                Waterfront to a military helicopter evacuation point on the far
                side of The Bridge.

              <h1 class="tabhead">Campaign</h1>
              <p>
                During Campaign, also known as Co-op, up to four players work
                together to try and reach the end of the campaign by fighting
                their way past large numbers of AI-controlled Infected. There
                are four difficulty: Easy, Normal, Advanced and Expert. Each
                chapter ends in a safe room, which acts as a checkpoint that is
                triggered when all living Survivors get inside the safe room and
                close the door behind them.<br /><br />
                In Campaign mode, one or more players play as the Survivors,
                with the rest of the four filled in with AI-controlled "Bots".
                The Survivors play through each chapter, making their way from
                safe room to safe room. The last stage in each campaign has an
                expanded ending called the Finale, which usually ends with
                players escaping on Rescue Vehicles like boats, helicopters,
                etc.<br /><br />
                If the Survivor dies at any point before the Finale, they will
                respawn in a Rescue Closet after some time and ask for anyone to
                get them out. Also, if all Survivors are dead or incapacitated,
                the campaign's current chapter will be restarted with all the
                weapons and items they had in the safe room when loading into
                the map. However, should the players die and leave the bots
                alive during the Co-op mode, the game acts as if all Survivors
                were dead, triggering the chapter restart.

              <h1 class="tabhead">Single Player</h1>
              <p>
                Single Player is a gameplay mode with only one player controlled
                character. The player assumes control of one of the Survivors,
                and all the other characters are AI controlled. No other player
                can join a Single Player game, unless locally (LAN), via the
                connect "host local IP" console command. Other than that, the
                same rules as Campaign apply here, except for in Dead Center, or
                The Passing where you only have to get 8 Gas cans in Solo Dead
                Center (13 in standard Campaign mode) and 10 in Solo The Passing
                (16 in standard Campaign mode) to compensate for the fact
                A.I.-controlled Survivors never attempt to pick up the gascans.
                <br /><br />
                Single Player is the only mode which can be played with Steam in
                Offline mode. Since Single Player is considered as local server,
                modifications that work only on local server will also work in
                this mode.
                <br /><br />
                In Single-player, if you die during the Campaign, the chapter
                will restart since bots don't use Defibrillators (unless mods
                has been used to allow bots continue on their own). Also, if you
                complete the campaign with everyone surviving, it will say "The
                Survivors have escaped!" or "In memory of [name/s of deceased
                survivors in the finale]" if the player escapes but the bots
                failed. The only time Campaign can be completed with the player
                dying as a result is Port Finale of The Sacrifice Campaign, as
                bots are not programmed to go and restart the generator and
                therefore the player's death won't fail the campaign for
                balancing reasons.

              <p>
                Survival mode gameplay in Left 4 Dead 2 remains similar to Left
                4 Dead's survival mode, with the difference being the new items
                and infected.
                <br /><br />
                More items for the survivors such as Adrenaline shots, Bile
                Bombs, more varied weapons and weapon upgrades, and the addition
                of Uncommon Infected and more Special Infected results in a
                different gameplay experience compared to Left 4 Dead. Moreover,
                the Jockey, alongside the Hunter, gain the area of effect stun
                on survivors near pinned teammates, which is twice as long as in
                Versus mode.
                <br /><br />
                There is a variant of Survival Mode, a mutation called Versus
                Survival. Following both Versus and Survival formulas, the
                Special Infected are played by a human team and both teams must
                compete for a better time than their opponent to continue the
                game until one team fails. This mutation became an official game
                mode as part of The Last Stand Community Update on September 24,
                2020.

              <h1 class="tabhead">Versus Survival</h1>
              <p>
                Versus Survival (also called Survival Versus) is a mixed
                gameplay mode between Versus and Survival where the match is
                started in a Survival map with the Survivors fending off against
                Special Infected controlled by players instead of Bots. In this
                mode, the Survivor team hold out in an area and fight against
                the Infected to obtain medals while the Infected team's job is
                to kill the Survivors as quickly as possible. Tanks have their
                health reduced to 4000 and only one tank can be active at any
                time. The Survivors have 90 seconds at the start of the round to
                set up until the infected side can spawn or they can trigger the
                infected to spawn earlier if they wish to do so by using the
                event start button. If all Survivors are dead or incapacitated,
                the teams swap and if one team fails to beat the opposing team's
                time then the match ends.

              <h1 class="tabhead">Versus</h1>
              <p>
                Versus is the basic competitive mode for the Left 4 Dead series:
                two separate teams of four players take turns playing as the
                Survivors and the Infected competing for the most points. In
                Left 4 Dead, points are only awarded to teams playing as the
                Survivors. Points are calculated by the amount of health left in
                each player and how far the team got. In Left 4 Dead 2, points
                are still only awarded to the Survivors but no longer use the
                amount of health left in each Survivor in the score. Instead,
                points are awarded solely on how far each Survivor got before
                they died and if they made it to the safe room alive. The points
                possible for each chapter is the same for both teams. Should
                both teams make it to the safe room without casualties and
                without the use of a defibrillator, then the Tie Breaker
                calculates how much damage each team did to the opposing team,
                awarding 25 points to the winner.
                <br /><br />
                Before a game starts, the lobby leader chooses a specific
                campaign to play and the players can choose which team to play
                on by choosing whether to start as the Infected or the
                Survivors. For help as Infected or Survivors, review some
                tactics.

              <h1 class="tabhead">Realism Versus</h1>
              <p>
                Realism Versus follows normal rules for Versus in terms of
                gameplay style and scoring, but makes things harder for the
                Survivors as they are bound by Realism rules. Common Infected
                are tougher, there are no glows around Survivors or items, and
                the Witch can kill in one hit, among others. On the Xbox 360
                version of the game, Realism Versus will appear in the main
                menu, but only if The Passing DLC has been downloaded.
                <br /><br />
                Common Infected are able to take a lot of damage before dying,
                and body shots are far less effective. The only weapons that can
                kill the Common Infected regardless of where they hit are the
                Magnum, M60, and melee weapons.
                <br /><br />
                Players are unable to see their fellow Survivors through walls
                or when they are in danger (i.e. vomited on, smoked, pounced,
                charged, incapacitated, etc.) so always stay together, and
                remain alert for Special Infected.
                <br /><br />
                Be cautious when encountering the Witch; she is able to kill the
                Survivor instantly, so be evasive especially in the "Hard Rain"
                campaign.
                <br /><br />
                Search carefully: items do not have (blue) outlines around them
                unless you're close to them (in which case they will glow white,
                indicating they are reachable).
                <br /><br />
                Speech bubbles over Survivors' heads are disabled, but it will
                still display above the character's icon on the HUD.

              <h1 class="tabhead">Realism</h1>
              <p>
                Realism can be played on any difficulty setting. This mode
                removes the Survivor auras usually shown around players through
                walls. Also, halos for items or weapons only appear if you are
                close enough to do their action (such as grabbing a weapon or
                pressing a switch). Realism mode also includes a damage penalty
                for body shots. Rescue closets are removed, making the
                defibrillator the only way to revive dead Survivors until you
                reach the safe house, where they will respawn for the next
                round. Witches kill instantly on any difficulty except Easy and
                no longer receive bonus damage from point-blank shotgun blasts,
                making cr0wning impossible. Speech bubbles over the Survivors
                are disabled when speaking via the microphone, although the
                speech bubble still appears above the character's icon. Overall,
                this gameplay mode was created to take the teamwork factor that
                made the Left 4 Dead series famous to the next level. Realism
                can also be played by creating your own lobby.

              <p>
                Scavenge is a competitive gameplay mode in Left 4 Dead 2. It is
                a round-based gamemode in which Survivors have a limited amount
                of time to find up to 21 gas cans to fuel up a generator (or
                car), while fighting against player-controlled Special Infected
                much like in a Versus game. Games can consist of one, three, or
                five rounds total, though not all of them may be played. After
                all the Survivors are incapacitated, the time runs out, or the
                Survivors collect all of the gas cans, the teams switch sides.
                Whichever team collects the most gas cans in a single round wins
                that round. If both teams collect the same number of gas cans,
                the team that collected them the fastest wins that round. When
                one of the teams wins either one, two, or three rounds (if there
                are one, three, or five rounds total, respectively), that team
                wins the match.

          <p>
            This is our dedicated website for us fan of this series. It is a fun
            horror survival game that we love to replay every campaign of it.
            The characters, the level of difficulty every stage, the fun game
            modes, the zombie archetypes and the goofiness of the mechanics. It
            is still a memorable game of horror survival genre and we hope we
            still have this kind of game
          </p>
