              The story of Left 4 Dead 2 first takes place in Savannah, Georgia.
              After the past event in Left 4 Dead 1. The four survivor climbs to
              the rooftop to witness the last rescue helicopter leave them. This
              is where they greet and know each other. Namely: Ellis, Coach,
              Rochelle and Nick. After that they decided to find evacuations to
              go to another rescue place where they can find help. The first
              place is exiting the building and going to the mall where they
              find a sports car and ellis had an idea to fill it up with gas so
              they can make a drive to New Orleans where they heard to be the
              last standing city of America. The team found a bridge in Rayford
              where they met the first team survivors in Left 4 Dead 1. Namely:
              Francis, Louis and Zoey. Their one member Bill sacrificed his life
              to raise the bridge thats why hes no longer here. The current
              survivors needs to cross the bridge they must find another way to
              across and refill the generator. While battling the infected by
              the first team they began to refill the generator and after that
              the 2 team met again and help them lower the bridge.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br />
              The current team began to drive off the bridge to Griffin County,
              where they come ahead to the whispering oaks amusement park. Where
              they go to the peach pit that is abandoned by midnight riders. The
              survivors succeed to get the helicopters attention to help them
              while the infected swarm the stadium. After being rescued the
              pilot becomes infected so nick shoot him causing the helicopter to
              crash. After the crash they went to discover a small village where
              a lot of villagers where infected as they go ahead to the swamp
              they come across a lot of dead militaries and crashed planes. The
              previous survivors informed the passerby to go to the plantation
              house. Where they find a radio that helps them contact virgil for
              rescue. Before fending off the horde, virgil blasts the plantation
              gate open to allow the survivors to escape on his boat before the
              horde could get them. While on their way the boat began to low on
              gas so they stopped at ducatel, Mississippi to find gas. The gas
              station that has supply are around two miles away so they pass
              through an abandoned sugar mill where they found a lot of witches.

              After collecting what they needed they began to go back but a
              heavy storm hits. Coach comes up with the idea to use the burger
              tanks signal to get virgils attention to pick them up before the
              swarm get them they left successfully. Virgil drops the team to
              New Orleans. After virgil dropped them they go outside of the safe
              house where they see jets and militaries in the area revealing
              that the military has not abandoned the city yet. They decided
              that the bridge is the best chance of survival but discovers that
              a lot of non-infected people corpses are on the way. They
              discovered that the military will bomb the bridge so they quickly
              pass across the bridge on all their power. As they pass the bridge
              they reached the 2 military the papa gator and rescue 7 who
              suspect that the survivors are carriers. Rescue 7 is prepared to
              carry the carriers, papa gator informs the survivor that they are
              lucky the military just left the are with them. As they are
              carried in the rescue helicopter the fighter jets bombed the
              bridge where they cross to prevent the infected from leaving the
              city and the pilot takes the survivors out to a military cruise
              ship at sea. This is where the story of Left 4 Dead 2 ends.

                            producer for a news station with a high reputation,
                            though her job had more to do with moving cables and
                            coffee duties. She was in Savannah producing a
                            segment about the evacuation center when the area
                            became overrun with the Infected. She wears a pink
                            T-shirt with a Depeche Mode logo, silver hoop
                            earrings, blue jeans, a thin studded belt around her
                            waist, two silver bracelets on her left arm and
                            knee-high brown boots. She also keeps her hair tied
                            in a bun.
