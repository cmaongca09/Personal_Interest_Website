              The story of Left 4 Dead 2 first takes place in Savannah, Georgia.
              After the past event in Left 4 Dead 1. The four survivor climbs to
              the rooftop to witness the last rescue helicopter leave them. This
              is where they greet and know each other. Namely: Ellis, Coach,
              Rochelle and Nick. After that they decided to find evacuations to
              go to another rescue place where they can find help. The first
              place is exiting the building and going to the mall where they
              find a sports car and ellis had an idea to fill it up with gas so
              they can make a drive to New Orleans where they heard to be the
              last standing city of America. The team found a bridge in Rayford
              where they met the first team survivors in Left 4 Dead 1. Namely:
              Francis, Louis and Zoey. Their one member Bill sacrificed his life
              to raise the bridge thats why hes no longer here. The current
              survivors needs to cross the bridge they must find another way to
              across and refill the generator. While battling the infected by
              the first team they began to refill the generator and after that
              the 2 team met again and help them lower the bridge.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br />
              The current team began to drive off the bridge to Griffin County,
              where they come ahead to the whispering oaks amusement park. Where
              they go to the peach pit that is abandoned by midnight riders. The
              survivors succeed to get the helicopters attention to help them
              while the infected swarm the stadium. After being rescued the
              pilot becomes infected so nick shoot him causing the helicopter to
              crash. After the crash they went to discover a small village where
              a lot of villagers where infected as they go ahead to the swamp
              they come across a lot of dead militaries and crashed planes. The
              previous survivors informed the passerby to go to the plantation
              house. Where they find a radio that helps them contact virgil for
              rescue. Before fending off the horde, virgil blasts the plantation
              gate open to allow the survivors to escape on his boat before the
              horde could get them. While on their way the boat began to low on
              gas so they stopped at ducatel, Mississippi to find gas. The gas
              station that has supply are around two miles away so they pass
              through an abandoned sugar mill where they found a lot of witches.

              After collecting what they needed they began to go back but a
              heavy storm hits. Coach comes up with the idea to use the burger
              tanks signal to get virgils attention to pick them up before the
              swarm get them they left successfully. Virgil drops the team to
              New Orleans. After virgil dropped them they go outside of the safe
              house where they see jets and militaries in the area revealing
              that the military has not abandoned the city yet. They decided
              that the bridge is the best chance of survival but discovers that
              a lot of non-infected people corpses are on the way. They
              discovered that the military will bomb the bridge so they quickly
              pass across the bridge on all their power. As they pass the bridge
              they reached the 2 military the papa gator and rescue 7 who
              suspect that the survivors are carriers. Rescue 7 is prepared to
              carry the carriers, papa gator informs the survivor that they are
              lucky the military just left the are with them. As they are
              carried in the rescue helicopter the fighter jets bombed the
              bridge where they cross to prevent the infected from leaving the
              city and the pilot takes the survivors out to a military cruise
              ship at sea. This is where the story of Left 4 Dead 2 ends.

              The Survivors are people in the world who have not contracted the
              Infection (either by virtue of being a carrier or possessing some
              form of immunity). The term, however, is commonly used to refer to
              the eight playable characters from the Left 4 Dead game series.
              <br /><br />
              At the start of the first campaign in Left 4 Dead 2, the playable
              characters have just met each other and do not know each other's
              names. There are also non-playable Survivors that players will
              meet throughout the campaigns. In the comic, the Survivors are
              referred to as "Tango-Mike" (T-M in the NATO Alphabet) by the APC
              Driver, probably in reference to Typhoid Mary, the most notorious
              real-life carrier known in America.
              <br /><br />
              Each playable Survivor has their own unique appearance,
              personality, dialogue, and backstory, making them easier to
              identify at a distance. Players can choose which Survivor they
              control in the lobby, or be automatically assigned to a Survivor
              that is not being controlled by a player when they join a game
              that is already in progress. Every Survivor plays the same; their
              physical differences are purely cosmetic and do not alter
              gameplay. When controlled as AI Bots, Survivors will have
              preference over specific weaponry, and will attempt to choose that
              type if possible.

              The Infected (sometimes referred to simply as Zombies by the
              survivors) are Left 4 Dead's take on the classic movie and
              pop-fiction zombie. Rather than being undead, they are living
              humans who have been Infected by the Green Flu virus, causing
              massively increased aggression and loss of many higher brain
              functions such as speech and self-preservation. Like cinematic
              zombies, those present in the Left 4 Dead series attack human
              victims until they themselves perish or kill their target.
              <br /><br />
              In the cases of Common and Uncommon Infected, observed
              aggressiveness manifests itself primarily in the form of frenzied
              physical blows and kicks. Bite attacks are of a secondary nature
              and may even be incidentally delivered. The Infected primarily
              attack uninfected humans who have attracted attention through
              noise, movement, displaying bright lights, or anything covered in
              Boomer Bile (whether it be from a Bile Bomb or the Boomer itself).
              Common Infected are also frequently observed displaying mutual
              aggressiveness towards one another. However, these attacks cease
              when the Infected find and focus on an uninfected human.
              <br /><br />
              The Special Infected have higher intelligence than the Common
              Infected, as they are not attracted by car alarms or loud noise
              and are able to run away if required to set up an ambush. They are
              also more aggressive than the Common Infected, as they will
              actively attack Survivors rather than passively sitting in a
              stupor until disturbed (except for the Witch and the Tank, which
              will wait for the Survivors to alert or attack them).
